// * Session 3 : Variables

// * A variable is a container, we can save a value and then use it later

// * The word " let " creates a new variable 
// * Syntaxe : let variableName = value;
// * Variable Name restrictions : special words like let , 
// * We can't start with a number like 1name ,
// * We can't use special characters like #&!@*^% except $ and _

// * Javascript has a special feature called Semicolon insertion , that mean it will try to insert the last semicolon in the line of code automatically 

// * when re-assigning a variable we don't use let
